## Project Information
This is our final project for CSCI 205 where we are constructing a digital version of the classic board 
game Candy Land. Candy Land is a basic children's game that requires players to pick cards and move to
the corresponding colored space. The first player to reach the final space wins. Due to the simplicity of 
the original game, the developers were able to be creative in the visual design and backend implementation.

Using JavaFX SceneBuilder, the graphics of the game were able to be colorful and emphasized the theme of 
Candy Land. These graphical elements were given purpose through the initSceneController class which connects
the 7 backend classes with the main scene.

## Package Structure
The primary components of this project's work is located within the src package. Under src, there is a test 
package containing all the JUnit Test classes. There is also a main package under src with the README.md and 
a folder for documents including the UserManual and DesignManual as well as one for design diagrams. In main, there is also a java folder of all
the programmed classes, and there is a folder called resources with all the used images and scenes.
